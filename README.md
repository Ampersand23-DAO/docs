## Think & Tink Tank | Academy, Institute, Lab

### Here you can find the docs, descriptions, ideas, notes, whitepaper and so on.

Ampersand23 is a place for all people of the world and is primarily committed to the acquisition and transmission of knowledge and skills.

Ampersand23 is mainly an academy, an institute, a laboratory, a school, a college, an university, but without the possibility of obtaining degrees. But it is a place where you can acquire the skills and knowledge to get a degree, certification or further education. At the same time, Ampersand23 serves as a laboratory and incubator that can be a springboard to develop your own projects.

And last but not least, Ampersand serves as a safe place of free exchange of knowledge and ideas in the security of a self-determined degree of anonymity. Ampersand23 is a DAO (based on the Ethereum bockchain) and as such is by its very nature self-governing. Everyone who participates can be an administrator, teacher, student, and project manager, and is free to choose to what extent they want to fill these roles.
